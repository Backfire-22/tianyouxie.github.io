# Internships and Projects

## Automated Installation of Tire Pressure Monitoring Sensors (TPMS)

**Senior Design Project**, Vanderbilt University (Fall 2025) — Sponsored by Nissan

Participated in a capstone project to automate the installation of tire pressure monitoring sensors.

## Assistant Engineer Intern — Robot Phoenix

**Jinan, China (Jul 2024 – Aug 2024)**

- Integrated a 6‑axis **UFactory xArm** with an **OAK‑D** depth camera for real‑time face tracking and pose estimation.  
- Built a **Python** program using the **DepthAI** framework to process depth and RGB data and extract facial position and orientation.  
- Developed a **C++** PID control module for dynamic arm adjustment, enabling smooth real‑time tracking via **UDP** communication.

## Dual‑Axis Analogue Joystick Controller

**Spring 2025**

- Designed, 3D‑printed and assembled the joystick’s mechanical structure.  
- Improved the prototype for better part quality and assembly accuracy.  
- Designed and soldered circuits and programmed the **Arduino** microcontroller.  
- Integrated mechanical and electrical systems and demonstrated the device at a department event.

## COMSOL Vortex Ring Simulation

**Spring 2025**

- Simulated laminar flow and species transport in **COMSOL** using a time‑dependent solver.  
- Constructed a locally refined mesh to balance accuracy and computational cost.  
- Defined boundary conditions for flow and dye concentration with a smooth pulsed inlet velocity.  
- Post‑processed vorticity and dye concentration fields, analysing variation under different Reynolds numbers.

## Optimal Scheduling and Path Planning for Multiple Robots in Isolation Areas

**Spring 2020 – Fall 2021**

- Implemented a genetic algorithm in **Python** to optimise the scheduling and allocation of disinfecting robots.  
- Visualised the allocation results in **MATLAB**.  
- Implemented the **A*** algorithm in **Java**.

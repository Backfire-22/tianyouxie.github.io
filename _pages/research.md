# Research Experience

## Integrating FEM‑Based Chemical Diffusion Model for the Non‑Homogeneity of Aortic Valve Calcification

**Researcher**, Vanderbilt University (Jul 2025 – Present)  
*Advisor: Dr. Haoxiang Luo*

- Implemented a diffusion solver in **MATLAB** using 3‑node triangular elements to simulate non‑homogeneous chemical distribution and validated it on an aortic valve surface mesh.  
- Preparing to present results as a poster at the **APS Conference** in November 2025.  
- Studied *Introduction to Finite and Spectral Element Methods Using MATLAB* and extended the methods to 3D surfaces.  
- Coupled the algorithm with FSI code to feed chemical species concentration to a **PySB** model for predicting uneven calcification across the aortic valve.

## A Framework for Modal Analysis of 3D Immersed Boundary Fluid–Structure Interaction

**Research Assistant**, Vanderbilt University (Jul 2025 – Present)  
*Advisor: Dr. Haoxiang Luo*

- Pre‑ and post‑processed FSI simulation data, reorganising it for input into **POD** and **DMD** analyses.  
- Merged $u$, $v$, $w$ velocity components from partitioned simulation outputs, removed inactive cells and organised each timestep into an $n\times100$ matrix.  
- Mapped DMD velocity fields back to the original mesh for **ParaView** visualisation and generated flow domain figures for a manuscript.  
- Designed a flexible workflow to handle multiple datasets and formats.  
- Post‑processed results and visualised **Q2** criteria and vorticity.

## Coupling 3D Fluid–Structure Interaction with a Systems Biology Model to Predict Calcification of Aortic Valve

**Research Assistant**, Vanderbilt University (Sep 2024 – Oct 2025)  
*Advisor: Dr. Haoxiang Luo*

- Visualised existing data as graphs, set up in‑silico experiments, contributed to **PySB** code, wrote equations and produced diagrams.  
- Collected and visualised experimental data using **MATLAB** and **ParaView** for model fitting.  
- Developed biochemical reaction models in **PySB**, including initial condition setup, post‑processing and unit conversion fixes.  
- Contributed as second author to a peer‑reviewed paper, creating all images and diagrams.

## Mechanics Modeling, Design, and Additive Manufacturing of Individualised Trabecular Bone Bioscaffolds

**Research Assistant**, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Jul 2023 – Aug 2023)  
*Advisor: Dayong Li*

- Familiarised myself with data collection and recording.  
- Measured mechanical properties of human spine samples and captured **Micro‑CT** images for microstructure details.  
- Collected medical **CT** images of human spine samples for super‑resolution training.
